    <p>
        I literally know nothing about personal finance. In recent times, I've felt really clueless at a number of
        occassions with things related to finance.
        Some of these occasions were:
    <ul>
        <li> I had to file my taxes. I had no clue about what to do. Ended up paying
            about two thousand rupees to a third party.
        </li>
        <li>
            I've got money lying around in my Savings Account. I've got some money in mutual funds that I have no idea
            about. I also have money in stocks - and I don't know why.
        </li>
        <li>
            I don't have any insurance. I never knew that it was important to buy one. I recently got to know that it is
            important to buy an insurance.
        </li>
    </ul>

    I want to be woke - financially.
